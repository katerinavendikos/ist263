    My name is Katerina Vendikos and this is my website for IST 263. I am a political science major, and I am interested comparative government and politics. I have minors in information management & technology and psychology. I am not sure what I want to do post-grad yet but should figure that out soon as I am a senior. I enjoy spending my free time reading and being with my friends.
