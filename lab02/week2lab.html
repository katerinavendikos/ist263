    <h1>Katerina's Biography</h1>
    <h2>Personal</h2>
   
    <p>
    My name is Katerina Vendikos and this is my website for IST 263. I am a political science major, and I am interested comparative government and politics. I have minors in information management & technology and psychology. I am not sure what I want to do post-grad yet but should figure that out soon as I am a <strong>senior.</strong> I enjoy spending my free time reading and being with my friends. </p>
    <p> I am from Brooklyn, New York and would love to return to the city post-grad. However, it could be fun to live in a different city and try something new. New York City has so much to offer but so do other cities. </p>
